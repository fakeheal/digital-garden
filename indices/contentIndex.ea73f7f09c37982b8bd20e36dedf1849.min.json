Example: `0x6dfed4`. The first byte of the memory has address of `0x000000`, the next one's address is `0x000001`, 256th byte of the memory's address is `0x0000FF` = $255_{(10)}$ \n\nVariables, created to store addresses, are called pointers. Pointers are defined using a data type and the `*` operator, placed infront of the name of the variable:\n\n```cpp\nint *myPointer;\n```\n\nThe `\u0026` prefix causes the statement to evaluate to the memory address of the identifier, **so long as the identifier is a primitive type**.\n\n```cpp\nint x;\n\u0026x; // gets the address of x\n```\n\nThe address is **the first byte** of the sequence of bytes required to store the data of the specific type.\n\n```cpp\ndouble myVar = 4.00;\n\u0026d; // 0x0000C9 (201(10)) + 8 bytes = 0x0000D0 (208(10))\n```\n\nThe `\u0026` operator cannot be applied to unnamed constants or an arithmetic operation: `\u00265`, `\u0026(a-5)`.\n\nTo get the value of the variable the pointer is referrencing to use the `*` operator:\n\n```cpp\nstd::string food = \"Pizza\"; // Variable declaration  \nstd::string *ptr = \u0026food;// Pointer declaration  \n  \n// Reference: Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)  \nstd::cout \u003c\u003c ptr \u003c\u003c \"\\n\";  \n  \n// Dereference: Output the value of food with the pointer (Pizza)  \nstd::cout \u003c\u003c *ptr \u003c\u003c \"\\n\";\n```\n\n\u003e If a pointer has the value of `0` or `NULL`, it does not point to data in the memory.\n\nA pointer can have the value of another pointer, provided they are of the same type.\n\n```cpp\nint *p1 = 0, *p2 = NULL;  \nint h = 10;  \np1 = \u0026h; p2 = p1;  \nstd::cout \u003c\u003c *p2 \u003c\u003c std::endl;\n```\n\nPointers can be assigned to data of the type they were defined with, unless they were defined as `void`. **Void pointers** can be assigned to pointers of all types, **with casting**. Pointers of all types can be assigned to void pointers **without casting**.\n\n```cpp\nvoid *v;  \nint *p;  \nint i = 0, j = 1;  \nv = \u0026i;  \np = (int *) v;  \nstd::cout \u003c\u003c *p \u003c\u003c std::endl;  \np = \u0026j;  \nv = p;  \nstd::cout \u003c\u003c *(int *) v \u003c\u003c std::endl;\n```\n\nIn the **constant pointers to constants**, the data pointed to by the pointer is constant and cannot be changed. The pointer itself is constant and cannot change and point somewhere else.\n\n```cpp\nconst int ci = 3; \nconst int *q = \u0026ci;\n```\n\nIn **constant pointers**, the pointer points to a fixed¬†memory location, and the value at that location can be changed because it is a variable, but the pointer will always point to the same location because it is made constant here.\n\nIn the **pointers to constant**, the data pointed by the pointer is constant and cannot be changed. Although, the pointer itself can change and points somewhere else (as the pointer itself is a variable).\n\nWe can create a pointer to a pointer that in turn may point to data or another pointer. The syntax simply requires the unary operator `*` for each level of indirection while declaring the pointer.\n\n```cpp\nchar a;\nchar *b;\nchar **c;\na = 'g';\nb = \u0026a;\nc = \u0026b;\n```\n\n**Pointer comparison** is done by comparing the addresses. **Incrementing** or **decrementing** the pointer, changes its address by the specified value multiplied by the number of bytes needed for its data type.\n\n### Arrays\n**Arrays** are made of multiple sequently ordered objects of the same data type.

From a macro.\")\n}\n```\n\n## Mutability\n\nVariables in Rust are immutable by default.\n\nTo make a variable mutable, use the keyword `mut`:\n\nExample:\n\n```rust\nlet mut weight = 51.14;\n```\n\n## Ownership\n\nRules of ownership, concept absent from most programming languages:\n1. Each value in Rust is owned by a variable\n2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be deallocated\n3. There can only be **ONE** owner at a time\n\nExample:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {  \n    let input: String = String::from(\"test\");  \n  \n    some_fn(input);  \n  \n    println!(\"Input is: {}\", input);  \n}  \n\nfn some_fn(s: String) {  \n    s;  \n}\n```\n\nThe value of `input` is not available to the `println!`  macro, because its ownership is transfered to `s` (of `some_fn`) and when `s`  goes out of scope it's deallocated and so is the value of `input`.\n\n### References \u0026 Borrowing\n\nImproving on the example above, we can actually pass `input` to `some_fn` without losing its value, by telling Rust we are going to pass it by reference:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {  \n    let input: String = String::from(\"test\");  \n    \n    some_fn(\u0026input);  \n    \n    println!(\"Input is: {}\", input);  \n}\n\nfn some_fn(s: \u0026String) {  \n    s;  \n}\n```\n\nHowever `s` in `some_fn` is immutable and if we want to update its value, the compiler won't let us.\n\nTo change that behaviour, we need not only to tell that we are passing reference to `some_fn`, but also tell it's going to be a mutable reference using `\u0026mut`.\n\nFinal code:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {  \n    let mut input: String = String::from(\"test\");  \n    some_fn(\u0026mut input);  \n    println!(\"Input is: {}\", input);  \n}  \n  \nfn some_fn(s: \u0026mut String) {  \n    s.push_str(\"!\");  \n}\n```\n\nIn the same scope, we can have only one mutable borrow or as many as we want immutable borrows.\n\nThe compiler won't let us have an immutable and mutable borrow at the same time.","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T15:55:54.008407707Z","tags":null}}
