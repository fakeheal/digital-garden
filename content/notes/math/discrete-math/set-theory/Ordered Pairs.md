*(ordered $n$-tuples / подредени $n$-торки)*

The pair of elements of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|set]] that occur **in a particular order** and are enclosed in brackets is called a set of ordered pairs.

$$ A = \{1,2\}, B = \{2, 1\}, A = B $$
$$(1, 2) \neq  (2,1)$$
$$(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,\dots,x_n) = (y_1, y_2,y_3,y_4,\dots, y_n)$$
