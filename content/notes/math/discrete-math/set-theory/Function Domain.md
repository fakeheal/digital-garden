*дефиниционната област*

The **domain** of a function is the [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|set]] of inputs accepted by the function. It sometimes is denoted by $dom(f)$ or $dom f$, where $f$ is the function.

More precisely, given a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$, the domain of $f$ is $X$.
