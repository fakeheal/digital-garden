Two [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|sets]] are said to be **disjoint sets** if they have no element in common. Equivalently, two disjoint sets are sets whose [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Intersection|intersecton]] is the [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Empty Set|Empty Set]].
