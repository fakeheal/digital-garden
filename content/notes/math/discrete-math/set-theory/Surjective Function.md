A **surjective function** is a function whose image is equal to its [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Function Codomain|codomain]]. Equivalently, a function $f$ with [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Function Domain|domain]] $X$ and codomain $Y$ is **surjective** if for every $y$ in $Y$ there exists at least one $x$ in $X$ with $f(x) = y$.
