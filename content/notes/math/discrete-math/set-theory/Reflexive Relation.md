If $\rho \in A \times A$ ( $\rho$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Relation|relation]]):

$\rho$ is reflexive in $A$, if for each $x \in A$ then $x \: \rho \: x$.

Examples:

Reflexive is the binary relation of 

- "equal to" on the set of real numbers.
- "is a subset of" (set inclusion)
- "divides"
