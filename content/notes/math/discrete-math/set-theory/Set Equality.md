**Axiom[^1] of Extension** (*аксиома на удължаването / разширението*):  a [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|set]] is determined by what its elements are - not in the order in which they might be listed or the fact that some elements might be listed more than once.

We say that [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|sets]] $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if $A \subset B$ и $B \subset A$.

$$
A= \{1,2,3\} \text{, } B = \{1, 1, 2,3\} \text{, } A = B
$$

**Set equality** is also a [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Relation|Relation]] between two sets.

[^1]: **axiom**: a statement that is taken to be true to serve as a starting point for further reasoning and arguments
