**Set** is a collection of things, called elements.

Notation defining a set:

$$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\dots\}$$
Capital letters are used for set names, elements are separated with comma and ellipsis (…) is used:

-    as a shortcut for listing many elements, when in the middle for finite sets
-   to indicate a set goes on forever, when at the end for infinite sets

Notation for representing:

- An element belongs to a set:  $1 \in B$
- An element does not belong to a set: $5 \notin B$
