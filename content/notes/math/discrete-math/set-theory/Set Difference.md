The difference between [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|set]] $A$ and $B$ is a set that contains all elements of $A$, but no elements of $B$.


$$A \textbackslash B = \{x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}$$

The difference between a set $A$ and the [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Universal Set]] is called the absolute [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Complement|complement]].

The difference between sets $A$ and $B$ is also an [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Intersection|intersection]] of $A$ and the [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Complement|complement]] of $B$ ($\overline{B}$).

$$A - B = A \cap \overline{B}$$
