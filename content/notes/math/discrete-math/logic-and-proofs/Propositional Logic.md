## Conditional statements

You will encounter most if not all of the following ways to express this conditional statement:

- “if p, then q”  
- “if p, q”  
- “p is sufficient for q”  
- “q if p”  
- “q when p”  
- “a necessary condition for p is q” “q unless ¬p”
- “p implies q”  
- “p only if q”  
- “a sufficient condition for q is p” “q whenever p”  
- “q is necessary for p”  
- “q follows from p”
