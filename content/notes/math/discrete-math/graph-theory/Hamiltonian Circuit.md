A **Hamiltonian Circuit** in a graph $G$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Circuit (Graph)|circuit]] that contains each [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] in $G$ exactly once, except for the starting and ending vertex that **appears twice**.

Removing any edge from a **Hamiltonian circuit** produces a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Hamiltonian Path|Hamiltonian path]].
