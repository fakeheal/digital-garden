> The set of all [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]] of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] can be [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Partition of a set|partitioned]] into [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Cycle (Graph)|cycles]] iff every vertex is of even [degree](app://obsidian.md/Degree%20(Graph)).

------

> A graph is [bipartite graph](app://obsidian.md/bipartite%20graph) iff each of his [cycles](app://obsidian.md/Cycle%20(Graph)) are of even length.

A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Forest|forest]] if and only if each pair of distinct [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]] $\{x, y\}$ there's only one [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Path (Graphs)|path]] from $x$ to $y$.
