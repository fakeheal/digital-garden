A **Hamiltonian Path** in a graph $G$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Path (Graphs)|path]] that contains each [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] in $G$ exactly once. If it ends at the vertex it started at it is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Hamiltonian Circuit|Hamiltonian Circuit]].

A **Hamiltonian path** that starts and ends at [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Adjacency (Graph)|adjacent]] vertices can be completed by adding one more [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] to form a Hamiltonian Circuit.
