An **Euler Circuit** is an [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Euler Trail|Euler Trail]] that visits every [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] exactly once and starts and ends at the same [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]].

A **Euler Circuit** exists in a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] iff every [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] has an even [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]].
