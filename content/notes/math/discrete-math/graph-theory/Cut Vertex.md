A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] whose deletion along with [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Incidence (Graph)|incident]] [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]] results in a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] with more [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Components|components]] than the original graph is called **cut vertex**.
