If a simple [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ with $n \geq 3$  [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]], and if $deg(v) + deg(w) \geq n$ for each pair of non-adjacent vertices $v$ and $w$, then $G$ is [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Hamiltonian Graph|Hamiltonian]].

If any of the conditions in **Ore's Theorem** are not satisfied, it doesn't mean that the graph $G$ is not Hamiltonian.
