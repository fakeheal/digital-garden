An **incidence matrix** is a [[notes/Mathematics/Linear Algebra/Matrix|matrix]] that shows the relationship between two classes of objects, usually called an *incidence relation*. If the first class is $X$ and the second is $Y$, the matrix has one row for each element in $X$ and one column for each element of $Y$. The entry in row $x$ and column $y$ is $1$ if $x$ and $y$ are [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Incidence (Graph)|incident]] and $0$ if they are not.
