Two [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graphs]] $G$ and $G'$ are **homeomoprhic** if there is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph Isomorphism|graph isomorphism]] from the [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Subdivision (Graph)|subdivision]] of $G$ to some **subdivision** of $G'$.
