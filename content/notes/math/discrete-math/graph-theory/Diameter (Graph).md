The **diameter** of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is the maximum [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Eccentricity (Vertex)|eccentricity]] of any [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] in $G$.

The diameter of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnected graph]] equals $+\infty$.
