A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is **disconnected** if there exists two [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] in $G$ such that no [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] in $G$ has these vertices as [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Endpoint|endpoint]].

The opposite of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph]].
