A **subdivision** of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is a graph resulting from the subdivision of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]] in $G$. The subdivision of some edge $e$ with endpoints $\{u, v\}$ yields a graph containing one new vertex $w$, and with an edge set replacing $e$ by two new edges $\{u, w\}$ and $\{w, v\}$.

**Example**:
