The total degree of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] is the sum of the [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Degree (Vertex)|degree]]  of its [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]]. The number can be found using the [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Handshaking lemma|Handshaking lemma]].

The [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Handshaking lemma|Handshaking lemma]] also implies that
- the total degree of a graph is always an [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Parity#^2338e6|even]] number 
- there are an [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Parity#^2338e6|even]] number of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] of odd degree
