[[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|Graph]] $H$ is said to be a **subgraph** of a graph $G$ if, and only if, every [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertex]] in $H$ is also a vertexin $G$, every [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] in $H$ is also an edge in $G$, and every edge in $H$ has the same endpoints as it has in $G$.
