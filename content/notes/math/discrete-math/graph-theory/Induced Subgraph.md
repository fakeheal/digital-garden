An **induced [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Subgraph|subgraph]]** of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] is another graph, formed from a [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Subset|subset]] of the [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] of the graph and **all** of the edges (from the original graph) connecting pairs of vertices in that subset.

Every graph is an induced subgraph of itself.
