A tournament is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Directed Graph|directed graph]] obtained by assigning a *direction* for each [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] in an [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Complete Graph|undirected complete graph]]. 

In every **tournament** there's a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Hamiltonian Path|Hamiltonian path]].

Every strongly connected [^1] tournament has a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Hamiltonian Circuit|Hamiltonian cycle]].


[^1]: **strongly connected:** a graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is *reachable* from every other vertex
