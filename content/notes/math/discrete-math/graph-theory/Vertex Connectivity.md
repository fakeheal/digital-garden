The vertex connectivity is the smallest number of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] whose deletion causes a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] to be [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnected]], denoted by $K(G)$.
