*line connectivity*

The **edge connectivity** of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] is the minimum number of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]] whose deletion from a graph separate the remaining nodes into two or more [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnected graphs]], denoted by: $\lambda{G}$.
