A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Directed Graph|directed graph]] formed by giving an orientation to every [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] $ab$ in an [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Undirected Graph|undirected graph]], such that it has at most one of the edges $\overrightarrow{ab}$ or $\overrightarrow{ba}$.

Oriented graphs have no [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Cycle (Graph)|2-cycles]].
