A **component** of an [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Undirected Graph|undirected graph]] is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected]] [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Subgraph|subgraph]] that is not part of any larger connected subgraph.

The components of any graph partition its [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] into [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Disjoint sets|disjoint sets]], and are the [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Induced Subgraph|induced subgraphs]] of those sets.
