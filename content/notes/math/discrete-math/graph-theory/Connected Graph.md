A [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is **connected** if and only if there is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Walk (Graph)|walk]] between each pair of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]].

The opposite of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Disconnected Graph]].
