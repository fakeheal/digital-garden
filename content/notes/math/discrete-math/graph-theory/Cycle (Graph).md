A **cycle** in a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] is a non-empty [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Circuit (Graph)|circuit]] in which only the first and last [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] are equal. 

**Cycle** with length $n$ is denoted by $C_n$.
