If $G$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] with $n$ [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]]:

-----

> $G$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] with no [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Cycle (Graph)|cycles]] (acyclic)

--------

> $G$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected graph]] with $n - 1$ [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]]

-------

> $G$ is [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Acyclic Graph|acyclic]] [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] with $n - 1$ [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edges]].

------

> $G$ is [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Connected Graph|connected]], but removing an [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnects]] $G$

--------

> $G$ is [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Acyclic Graph|acyclic]] [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]], but adding an [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Edge|edge]] that connects any two not incident [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] makes $G$ cyclic.

---------

> For all pairs of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] $x, y$ exists only one [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Path (Graphs)|path]]  in $G$ with [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Endpoint|endpoints]] $x$ and $y$.
