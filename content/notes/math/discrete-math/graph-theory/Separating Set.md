A **separating set** of a [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Graph|graph]] $G$ is a [[notes/math/discrete-math/set-theory/Set|set]] of [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Vertex|vertices]] whose deletion [[notes/math/discrete-math/graph-theory/Disconnected Graph|disconnects]] $G$. A graph can have multiple **separating sets**.
