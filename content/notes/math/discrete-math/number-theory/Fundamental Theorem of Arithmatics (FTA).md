**Fundamental Theorem of Arithmatics (FTA)** every integer greater than $1$ is either a prime or it is a products of [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Prime numbers|primes]], and this product is unique.


## Prime factorization

### Any factor Method

Just find any factor, and continue the fractorizaton, until all factors are primes:

$$
\begin{align}
& 90 && \\
& 9 \times 10 && \\
& 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 2&
\end{align}
$$

### Division

Start dividing the number by the smallest prime until we get to $1$.

$$
\begin{align}
& 90 && \\
& 90 \div {\color{green}{2}} = 45 && \\
& 45 \div {\color{green}{3}} = 15 && \\
& 15 \div {\color{green}{3}} = 5 && \\
& 5 \div {\color{green}{5}} = 1 && \\
& {\color{green}{2}} \times {\color{green}{3}} \times {\color{green}{3}} \times {\color{green}{5}} = 90 &&
\end{align}
$$

### Factor Tree

A special diagram where we find the factors of a number, then the factors of those numbers, etc, until we can't factor any more.
