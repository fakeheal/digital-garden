**Least Common Multiple** of two integers $a, b$ is the smallest positive integer divisible by both $a$ and $b$.

**Example 1.**
$lcm(5, 11) = 55$


**Example 2.**
$lcm(4, 9) = 36$

List the multiples of each number, then look for the **smallest number that appears** in each list. 

## Formula

$$
\begin{align}
lcm_{(a, b)} = \frac{a \times b}{gcd(a, b)}
\end{align}
$$
