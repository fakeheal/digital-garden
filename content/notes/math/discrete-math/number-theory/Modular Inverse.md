$$(7 / 4) \bmod 5 = ?  $$
$$( 7 * \frac{1}{4}) \bmod 5 = ?$$ 
$$( 7 * 4) \bmod 5 = 3$$ 

When to know if a division in modular arithmetic has solution or no solution:

If the divisor and the module are [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Coprime Integers|coprimes]], then the division has solution.
