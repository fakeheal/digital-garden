## Left-truncatable prime
A [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Prime numbers|prime number]] which, in a given base, contains no 0, and if the leading ("left") digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.

$$9137, \text{ since } 9137, 137, 37 \text{ and } 7 \text{ are all prime}$$

## Right-truncatable prime

A [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Prime numbers|prime number]] which remains prime when the last ("right") digit is successively removed. 
$$7393, \text{ since }7393, 739, 73 \text{ and } 7 \text{ are all prime}$$

##  Left-and-right-truncatable prime

A [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Prime numbers|prime number]] is a prime which remains prime if the leading ("left") and last ("right") digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.

$$1825711, \text{ since }82571, 257 \text{ and } 5 \text{ are all prime}$$
