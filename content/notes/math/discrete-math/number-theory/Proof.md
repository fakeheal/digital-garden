**Proofs** are a finite sequence of claims that aim to show the truthfulness or falsehood of a statement.

$$\frac{A}{\text{the  statement}} \xrightarrow{tools / way} \frac{B}{\text{the  proof}}$$
**Tools:** 
- Axioms
- Definitions
- Theorems
- Propositions
- Postulates
- Facts 

**Ways**:
- *Direct Proofs*: Proofs where the truthfulness or falsehood of a statement is reached by a direct combination of established facts, theorems, and axioms
- *Induction Proofs*:
	1. Prove it for the base case $P(1)$
	2. Assume it is true for $P(n)$
	3. Then prove it for $P(n+1)$
- Contrapositive Proofs
- Exhaustion Proofs
- Construction Proofs
