**Prime numbers** are positive natural numbers $> 1$ that can only be divided by $1$ and themselves.

## Facts
1. The only even prime number is $2$
2. $0$ and $1$ are not prime numbers
3. No primer number $> 5$ ends in a $5$

$1$ is not a prime number, because it could be included into the prime factorization of any number multiple times, making the product of the prime factors not unique, thus "breaking" the [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Fundamental Theorem of Arithmatics (FTA)]].
