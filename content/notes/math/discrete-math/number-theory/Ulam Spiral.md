The **Ulam spiral** or **prime spiral** is a graphical depiction of the set of [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Prime numbers|prime numbers]], constructed by writing the positive integers in a square spiral and specially marking the prime numbers.

The Ulam spiral is constructed by writing the positive integers in a spiral arrangement on a square lattice:
