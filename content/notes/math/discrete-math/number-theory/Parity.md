**Parity** is the porperty of an [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/Integer|Integer]] of whether it is *even* or *odd*.

## Even

^2338e6

An even number is an integer of the form
$$
x = 2k
$$
where $k$ is an integer.

## Odd
An odd number is an integer of the form
$$
x=2k + 1
$$

## `x` / `+` of odd and even numbers

- even `+` even = even:  $2n + 2n = 4n = 2(2n)$
- even `+` odd = even: $2n + (2n + 1) = 4n + 1 = 2(2n) + 1$
- odd `+` odd = even: $(2n + 1) + (2n + 1) = 4n + 2 = 2(2n + 1)$
- even `x` even = even: $2n * 2n = 4n^2 = 2(2n^2)$
- even `x` odd = even: $2n * (2n + 1) = 4n^2 + 2n = 2n(2n +1)$
- odd `x` odd = odd: $(2n + 1) * (2n + 1) = 4n^2 + 2n + 1 = 2n(2n + 1) + 1$
