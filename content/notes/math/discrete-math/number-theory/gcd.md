**Greatest common divisor** is the greatest positive integer that can divide two or more integers without a remainder.

**Example 1.**

$$
gcd(2, 4, 6, 10, 100) = 2
$$

**Example 2.**

$$
gcd(2, 3, 9, 30) = 1
$$

If the **gcd** of two or more numbers $= 1$, then they are called *relative primes*.

## Formula

$$
\begin{align}
gcd_{(a, b)} = \frac{a \times b}{lcm(a, b)}
\end{align}
$$
