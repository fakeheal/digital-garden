## ... addition.

A set is closed under _addition_ if you can add any two numbers in the set and still have a number in the set as a result.

## ... (scalar) multiplication.

A set is closed under (scalar) _multiplication_ if you can multiply any two elements, and the result is still a number in the set.

-----

Generally, "closed under _some operation_" means the elements of the set are not being able to "escape" the set using that operation. The result always $\in$  the set they are from.
