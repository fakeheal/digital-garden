When two **rays** share a **point** they form an **angle**.

## Slope

A **slope** of a line is the change in $y$ coordinate ($\Delta{y}$) with respect to to the cahnge in $x$ coordinate ($\Delta{x}$).

To find the slope of $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$

$$
m = \frac{y_1 - y_2} {x_1 - x_2} 
$$

If the slope of a line is *zero*, then the line is perfectly horizontal.

If the slope of a line is *undefined*, then the line is perfectly vertical.

If a line is perfectly vertical & another line is perfectly horizontal, then the lines are perpendicular to each other.

### Parallel lines

If the slopes of two lines are equal, then they are parallel.

### Perpendicular lines

If the slope of one line is the negative and reciprocal of the another line, then the two lines are perpendicular.

## Distance

### In two-dimension

The distance between two points in the second dimension can be found using:

$$
d = \sqrt{\Delta{x}^2 + \Delta{y}^2}$$
### In three-dimension

$$
d = \sqrt{\Delta{x}^2 + \Delta{y}^2 + \Delta{z}^2}
$$

### Midpoint

The midpoint of a **line segment** is the point that is *equidistant* from both endpoints of the line segment. It **bisects** the segment.

To find the midpoint of a line segment $\overline{AB}$, where $A = (x_1, y_1)$ and $B = (x_2, y_2)$
$$
midpoint = (\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2})
$$
