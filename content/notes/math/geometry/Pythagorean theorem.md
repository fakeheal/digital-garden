The **Pythagorean theorem** shows how the length of the sides of a [[notes/math/geometry/Triangle|right triangle]] relate one another.

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
### Pythagorean inequalities

#### Acute triangle
All angles are smaller than 90$^\circ$

$$
a^2 + b^2 > c^2
$$


#### Right triangle 
There is one right angle

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
#### Obtuse triangle 
There is an angle greater than $90^\circ$

$$
a^2 + b^2 < c^2
$$
