**Angle** is a fraction of a circle. The **measure** of an angle is the size of the  "turn" (rotation) that's needed to get from the ray that forms one side of the angle to the ray that forms its other side.

**Supplementary angles** are angles which have measures that add to 180$^{\circ}$.
**Complementary angles** are angles which have measures that add to 90$^{\circ}$.

**Adjacent angles** are angles that:
- share a vertex and one ray/side
- their interiors don't overlap

**Non-adjacent angles** are angles that:
- may or may not share a vertex,
- but they don't share a ray or even if they share a ray their interiors don't overlap

## Transversal
*/transversal line - напречна линия/*

**Transversal** is a line that corsses at least two other lines.

#### "Special" Congruent Angles

- **Vertical angles** - $\angle{a} = \angle{b}, \angle{e} = \angle{f}, \angle{c} = \angle{d}, \angle{g} = \angle{h}$ - they share a vertex, but lie on the opposite sides of both the parallel lines and the transversal.
- **Corresponding angles** - $\angle{a} = \angle{e}, \angle{d} = \angle{h}, \angle{c} = \angle{d}, \angle{b} = \angle{f}$ - are matching angles that lie, one on each parallel line, on the same side of the parallel lines and the same side of the transversal. 
- **Alternate interior angles** - $\angle{d} = \angle{g}, \angle{b} = \angle{e}$ - are angles that lie, one on each line, on opposite sides of the parallel lines and opposite sides of the transversal, inside of the parallel lines.
- **Alternate exterior angles** -$\angle{a} = \angle{f}, \angle{c} = \angle{h}$ - are angles that lie, one on each line, on opposite sides of the parallel lines and opposite sides of the transversal, outside of the parallel lines.

#### "Special" Supplementary Angles

- **Consecutive interior angles** - $\angle{d} + \angle{e} = 180^{\circ}, \angle{b} + \angle{g} = 180^{\circ}$- are angles that lie, one on each parallel line, on opposite sides of the parallel lines, but on the same side of the transversal.
- **Adjacent angles** - $\angle{a} + \angle{d} = 180^{\circ}, \angle{a} + \angle{c} = 180^{\circ}, ...$ - are angles with the same vertex that lie on opposite sides of the parallel line, but on the same side of the transversal. 

### N-gons

The sum of angles in an [[notes/math/geometry/Polygon|n-gon]] is $(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}$.

**Polygon Exterior Angle Sum Theorem**: If a polygon is a convex polygon, then the sum of its exterior angles (one at each vertex) is equal to 360 degrees.
