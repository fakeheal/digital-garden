A **linear equation** is an equation that may be  put in the form of
$$
a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n + b = 0
$$
where $x_1,... x_n$ are the variables (or unknowns) and $b, a_1, ... a_n$ are the coefficients.
The coefficients may be considered as parameters of the equation, and may be arbitrary expressions, provided they do not contain any of the variables. 

Linear equations can be in:

### Standard Form

The **Standard Form** for a linear equation in two variables, $x$ and $y$, is usually given as
$$
Ax + By = C$$
where, if at all possible,
- $A$, B, and $C$ are integers, 
- and $A$ is non-negative, 
- and, $A$, $B$, and $C$ have no common factors other than 1.

If we have a linear equation in *slope-intercept form*, we can change that equation into **Standard Form**.

### Slope-intercept Form

The slope intercept form $$y = mx + b$$is used when you know the slope of the line to be examined and the point given is also the $y$ intercept $(0, b)$. In this form, $b$ represents the $y$ value of the $y$ intercept point.
