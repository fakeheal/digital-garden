There are a few special [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Unit Vector|unit vectors]] used in vector calculus and in linear algebra, which are called the **standard basis vectors**.

In **two-dimensional space**, we define two specific basis vectors, $\hat{i} = (1, 0)$ and $\hat{j} = (0, 1)$.  Based on their components, we can see that they have both length of $1$.

In **three-dimensional space**, the basis vectors are $\hat{i} = (1, 0, 0)$, $\hat{j} = (0, 1, 0)$, and $\hat{k} = (0, 0, 1)$.

Sometimes the basis vecots can be represented without the **hat**, just as the bolded characters **i**, **j** and **k**.
