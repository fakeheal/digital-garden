Within spaces ( $\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^3,\mathbb{R}^4,\dots,\mathbb{R}^n$), we can define **subspaces**.

To give na example, a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of two-dimensional [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Vector|vectors]] within $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the set meets three specific conditions:

1. The set includes the zero vector
2. The set is [[notes/math/discrete-math/number-theory/closed under|closed under]] [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Vector Operations|scalar multiplication]]
3. The set is closed under addition

> Keep in mind that the first condition, that **a subspace must include the zero vector**, is logically already included as part of the second condition, that **a subspace is closed under multiplication**.
