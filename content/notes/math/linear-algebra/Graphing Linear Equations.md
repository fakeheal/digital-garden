Graphing [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Linear Equation|linear equations]] can be done in different ways based on the form the equation is in.

### Standard form

Let our equation that is in [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Linear Equation|standard form]] be
$$
4x + 5y = 20
$$

To get the point where the line intercepts the $x$-axis "remove" $5y$ from the equation above and solve for $x$
$$
\begin{align}
4x = 20 \\ 
x = 5
\end{align}
$$

Identically, to get the point where the line intercepts the $y$-axis "remove" $4x$ from the equation and solve for $y$
$$
\begin{align}
5y = 20 \\
y = 4
\end{align}
$$

Finally draw a straight line between the points $(x, 0)$ and $(0, y)$ using the values of $x$ and $y$ we solve above.

### Slope-intercept form

Let our equation that is in [[notes/math/linear-algebra/Linear Equation|slope-intercept form]] be
$$
y = 2x - 3 
$$
To get started the value of the coefficient $b$ (and think of it as the $b$-egining of the $y$ intercept), so our starting point is $(0, b)$, in our case $(0, -3)$.

Then we use the value of the coefficient $m$, in our case $2$, to get the second point. Add $2$ to $(0, -3)$ and we get $(0, -1)$, then add the denominator of $m$, in our case $1$[^1] and we get $(1, -1)$ as our second point.

Finally draw a straight line between the points $(0, -3)$ and $(1, -1)$.

[^1]: $2$ can be represented as $\frac{2}{1}$
