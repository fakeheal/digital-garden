## Theorem
Between any two distinct real numbers, there exists an irrational number.

## Proof

Let $x$ and $y$ be two distinct real numbers with $x < y$ and $\sqrt{2}$ denotes the positive square root of $2$. Then, we have $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} < \frac{y}{\sqrt{2}}$. By [[notes/math/Proof of Density of rational numbers|theorem of density of rational numbers]], there exists a rational number $r$ such that $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} < r < \frac{y}{\sqrt{2}}$, which implies that $x < r \sqrt{2} < y$. Note that $r\sqrt{2}$  is an irrational number since $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Thus, we have successfully proved that there exists an irrational number between two distinct real numbers.
