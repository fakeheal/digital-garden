**Complete Residue Systems** (covering systems) is a set of integers such that every integer is [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Number Theory/Congruence|congruent]] to an unique member of the set module $n$.

$$
\begin{align}
& \bmod 4 && \\
& \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, \{5, 6, 7, 8\}, \{17, 18, 19, 20\}, \{81, 82, 83, 84\}, ... &&
\end{align}
