An excerpt of a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Set|set]].

$$A = \{1, 2, 3\}, B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}, A \subseteq B$$
$A$ is subset of $B$, if and only if, every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

Every set is a subset of itself: $A \subseteq A$, $B \subseteq B$,...

The empty set ($\varnothing$) is a subset of every set: $\varnothing \subseteq A$,$\varnothing \subseteq B$,...


## Proper subset $\subset$

when the set has more elements than the subset.

$$ A= \{1,2,3\}, B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}, A \subset B $$

$A$ being subset of $B$ is also a [[notes/Mathematics/Discrete Mathematics/Set Theory/Relation|relation]].
