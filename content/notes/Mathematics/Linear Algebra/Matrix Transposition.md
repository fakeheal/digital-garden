Тhe transpose of a [[notes/Mathematics/Linear Algebra/Matrix|matrix]] is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix $A$ by producing another matrix, often denoted by $A^T$.

$$
\text{if } A = (a_{ij}) \text{ then } A^T=(a_{ji})
$$

### Properties

- If $A$ has $m \times n$ dimension, then $A^T$ is $n \times m$ 
- $(A^T)^T = A$
- $(k \cdot A) ^T = k \cdot A ^T$
- $(A + B) ^ T = A^T + B^T$
- $(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$

Matrix $A$ is a symmetric matrix, if $A = A^T$. If both $A$ and $B$ are symmetric matrices, then their sum $A + B$ is also symmetrical.
