## Review

### Likes

- Graphics are amazing
- Controls are awesome - you can do lots of stuff and they've managed to find a place for everything and make it easily accessible
- Quirky dialogues 
- Lots of jokes
- Variety of content: side quests, main quests, battles, collectibles, etc
- 

### Dislikes
- As a person that's not really used to open world games, I got lost *constantly*
