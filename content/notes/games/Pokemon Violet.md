## Review

### Likes
- Not very repetitive
- Lots of Pokemons to capture
- Story is awesome (and kinda sad)
- Raids are fun every once in a while
- Picnics with friends are cool

### Dislikes
- It is sometimes very laggy
- Hatching eggs' animation is slow

## In Progress

- [ ] Hatch my very own shiny Shinx
- [ ] Get and finish the expansion - Area Zero
