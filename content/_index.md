**W**elcome to my first attempt at creating a ðŸª´ digital garden. 

My name is [Ivanka](https://itodorova.dev) and I am currently studying **Computer Science** at [New Bulgarian University](https://nbu.bg/).

As of now, this place mostly consists of computer science-y things, documented during my study, but my interests go beyond that topic. 

I love, *love* binging [[notes/recreational/TV Shows|TV Shows]] & [[notes/recreational/Movies|Movies]]. I also play [[notes/recreational/Gameshelf|games]], read teen fantasy [[notes/recreational/Bookshelf|books]], (*almost exclusively*) ðŸ™ˆ.

I use **tags** to group notes related to a similar topic. Some tags are created for the sole purpose of [[notes/projects/Self Quizing|searching for specific content programmatically]].
